# Our Journey
For too long have Monkeytype's moderators and minions reigned supreme! Their attempts to gatekeep and take advantage of the typing community have gone too far. We knew something had to be done.

# The Revolution Begins

In an attempt to put meaning into meaningless lives, we decide to attack a niche typing community known as monkeytype. we quickly developed 2 independent prototypes, one in javascript and the latter in Python. We overwhelm them with our faster Python prototype and are the #1 fastest typer in the world on their website. The man who spent 200 hours typing was dethroned in a matter of days by our plans. everything was going smoothly until...

The neckbeards opened their third eye and saw directly through our tricks. they banned us and removed us from the leaderboards merely hours after our first success. We tried to make another account but it was also struck down quickly, but this time, they IP banned my house, and our school.
Things were looking hopeless, and we could only see darkness in the road ahead. but one day, a light shined in the distance; guiding us to hope.

NON SYSTEM-WIDE KEY PRESSES
With this revolutionary technology, we could now run multiple instances of the typer at once. We immediately began creating accounts that we would load into a program that allows 10 instances to run simultaneously and continuously for nights at a time, pushing those accounts onto the leaderboards. With this new breakthrough technology on our hands, we were initially hopeful of eventual success. As long as we persevere, automatically creating new accounts as soon as old ones are banned, the humans moderating the platform would stand no chance. Without the ability and expertise to automatically ban bot accounts. We were ignorant of what we were about to discover.

# The Tyranny of The Numbers
Named after the problem computer scientists faced in the 1960s, we discovered that the difficulty of scaling our operation with our current equipment and technologies would scale up exponentially. We soon ran out of processing power to concurrently run the program, dramatically increasing the amount of time it takes to bring a new account onto the leaderboard. 

So here we stood, for eight months... 


Time went on. We finished first semester finals, embraced the joyous respite of winter break, and used that time to reflect, recharge, and envision new possibilities. Energized by our aspirations, we embarked on a transformative journey as we entered the build season of our robotics team. We also started our own company, driven by the desire to make a positive impact. After another fruitful few months, we marked the end of the second semester with a sense of accomplishment, with memories and ambitions of a MonkeyTypeless future behind us. As the warmth of summer embraced us, we embarked on a well-deserved break, cherishing the fruits of our labor and eagerly preparing for the adventures that awaited us in the days to come. I also had the stupid idea of finishing the entirety of Calculus BC in just two months. 

Everything would've been over if not for one thing, the final exam of my class. While procrastinating studying for the test, I decided to publish our code and story for the world to see and enjoy. An idea also popped into my head. If we can get other people to run the program at night as well, our dream might not be that far away. Last night, I spent two hours updating the code in response to recent UI changes to the terrible website. 

The code is now ready for mass deployment.
Join the fight -- destroy MonkeyType with us!


# MonkeyTypeDestroyer
Intelligent fully automated monkeytype bot that grinds the game for you

This is the most intelligent monkeytype bot ever created. You can run multiple instances and they can run all night and type at the exact specified speed and accuracy. the latest version of the bot is capable of bypassing monkeytype's lackluster Turing tests at speeds up to 350 wpm, appearing as a human. The program also logs in to your personal account, puts you on the leaderboards, and helps us by flooding the leaderboards with bots. 

the only dependencies necessary are the latest version of chromedriver, selenium and pynput. version 4.0 is only capable of typing at about 600 wpm on my device, but the earlier versions can go up to 20000 wpm on a more capable device with pynput. the limiting factor is the browser at that point. 

They cant stop all of us.
